    <h3> Welcome to the world's most advanced, state of the art website. Enjoy your visit!</h3>
    <p>Dylan Saxty, born on 1997, in some field off of Labelle in a mobile home, I was brought into this world with nothing and I tend to leave it with everything.
        I believe my self to be an all-around player to any team, I can always bring something 
        new and refreshing to the table and engage with others to fully flesh out both their ideas and my own. 
        Although not the smartest, I am not hopeless when facing new tasks and can easily adapt to it after fully analyzing the situation. 
        Technology is my number one interest, if we were at the point in time where integrating a computer with your body was possible,
        I'd do it.</p>

    <p>As for hobbies I'm very much a homebody, If I'm not at work or school I'm most likely at my computer, playing games or watching compilations on YouTube. 
        I was at one point a fluent Jazz Musician, second chair trumpet, but have since moved on to the piano and guitar. Progress on those two are a little sluggish at the moment.
        Besides winning soccer tournaments and getting awards from school, theres nothing I can look back at and be proud of myself for. 
        My biggest goal is to become an expert in programming, C# at the moment, and create an app that revolutionizes the industry.</p>

    <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin, California-Nevada. The objectives of the LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support from 12 federal and state agencies with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program (mandated by the Clean Water Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

    <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for restoration and sustainable use of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>
